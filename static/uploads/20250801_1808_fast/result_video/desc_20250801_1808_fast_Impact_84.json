  "description": "Impact posture: left shoulder-to-ankle vertical angle is 82.2°, roughly 7.8° off the target. Upper body leans slightly forward with the hips back, arms relaxed but engaged for control. Shift pressure into the trail foot while keeping eyes on the ball. Overall form is solid; tighten the angle to maximize compression.",
