  "description": "Top-of-backswing review: club-to-ground angle is a clean 0.4°, but the shoulder-X value (318.1°) and center angle (361.0°) show the torso has more rotation available. The trail arm is slightly bent, which can reduce width and power. Focus on a full turn with freely extended arms.",
